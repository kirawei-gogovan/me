## 🚀 About Me

🦄 Backend Tech Lead @ GoGoX (Mar 2024 ~ Present)  
🌏 Based in Taiwan | 📫 weizheng0924@gmail.com

With a decade of hands-on experience, I architect and scale backend systems that power real-world businesses—think global wallet platforms with 99.99% uptime, seamless payment integrations, and internal tools that actually make life easier. I thrive on elegant code, automation, and the never-ending pursuit of improvement.

## 💡 What I Do

- Lead cross-functional teams and streamline global delivery pipelines (across time zones and coffee zones).
- Build and optimize financial platforms, making sure your payments never sleep.
- Mentor engineers and unblock teams—because collaboration beats heroics.
- Design with uptime, scalability, and clarity in mind.
- Automate all the things (except making coffee—still working on that).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages:** Ruby on Rails, Go
- **Cloud & Infra:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring:** New Relic, Loki + Grafana, (and a sixth sense for system health)
- **Messaging:** Kafka

## 🏆 Career Highlights

- **Automation Artist:** Built reporting tools that let teams focus on what matters (not spreadsheets).
- **Startup Spirit:** Won the Best Startup Award in Taiwan’s Entrepreneurial Competition for a cloud-based housing management & energy-saving system.

## 🎨 Fun Facts

- I love solving puzzles—whether it’s system architecture or a stubborn Rubik’s Cube.
- Strong believer in “code is poetry”—striving for readability, elegance, and function.
- Ex-director of a community service club, because giving back matters.
